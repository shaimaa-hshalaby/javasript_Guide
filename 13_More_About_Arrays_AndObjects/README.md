An "object-like array" and an "iterable" are related concepts in JavaScript, but they have different purposes and characteristics:

1. Object-Like Array:
   - An "object-like array" typically refers to an object that has numeric property names (like "0", "1", "2", etc.) and is used to store values in a similar fashion to an array.
   - It does not have the built-in array methods or array-related behaviors, such as `push()`, `pop()`, `length`, and other array-specific features.
   - It doesn't implement the iterable protocol, which means you cannot directly iterate over its values using a `for...of` loop.

   Example of an object-like array:
   ```javascript
   const objLikeArray = {
     0: 'apple',
     1: 'banana',
     2: 'cherry'
   };
   ```

2. Iterable:
   - An iterable, on the other hand, is an object that implements the iterable protocol. It provides a way to iterate over its values using a `for...of` loop or other constructs that work with iterables.
   - It has a well-defined structure, including a `[Symbol.iterator]` method that returns an iterator object with a `next()` method.
   - Iterables can be built-in objects like arrays and strings or custom objects that you make iterable by implementing the iterable protocol.

   Example of an iterable array:
   ```javascript
   const iterableArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
   ```

The key difference is that iterable objects have a standard and well-defined way to access their values one at a time using iteration, whereas object-like arrays are essentially regular objects with numeric property names, and you would need to manually iterate over their properties to access their values.

In summary, object-like arrays are often used to mimic arrays but lack the array-specific behaviors, while iterables provide a standardized way to iterate over a collection of values, and many built-in data structures in JavaScript, like arrays and strings, are already iterable.
